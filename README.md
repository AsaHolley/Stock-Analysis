# Stock Analysis
This project is an analysis of green energy stocks using VBA to measure performance over the 2017-2018 timeframe. The analysis looked at 12 stocks in total and was meant to measure trading volumes and total returns in order to assist the climate in making more informed choices using past stock performance and trading volumes. The final product for this [Analysis](https://github.com/AsaHolley/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Challenge_AH.xlsm) was produced using VBA to run quickly using a refactored code that allowed the client to perform the analysis and see color coded results at the click of a button. 

## Comparison of Stock Returns and Refractored Code

From the below analysis it is clear between 2017 and 2018 a shift in sentiment happened on green stocks, with the notable expectations of ENPH and RUN. Both ENPTH and RUN produced outsized returns in both 2017 and 2018 while green stocks on a whole performed poorly after having a healthy 2017. It is also notable that both ENPH and RUN had higher trading volumes on average then their peer group in both years, which could indicate higher interest in these stocks from the broader market.
