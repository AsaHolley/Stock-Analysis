# Stock Analysis
This project is an analysis of green energy stocks using VBA to measure performance over the 2017-2018 timeframe. The analysis looked at 12 stocks in total and was meant to measure trading volumes and total returns in order to assist the climate in making more informed choices using past stock performance and trading volumes. The final product for this [Analysis](https://github.com/AsaHolley/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Challenge_AH.xlsm) was produced using VBA to run quickly using a refactored code that allowed the client to perform the analysis and see color coded results at the click of a button.
